Welcome to the social network app!<br>
This is a ruby on rails app, with postgresql!<br>
Above is an example of the home page, here you will find a space to tweet a message out, the timeline of messages of people you follow, and a search box to find new users to follow!


![profile](https://github.com/ScottGledhill/social_network/blob/master/app/assets/images/profile.png)

Here is an example of a profile page, which includes all your tweets, ordered by most recent at the top.<br>
If this is not your profile page, it also gives you the option to follow or unfollow!
